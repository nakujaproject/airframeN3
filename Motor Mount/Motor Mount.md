# **MOTOR MOUNTS**

A mount is required to secure the motor in place during flight. 
Requirements for the motor mount are:

	- It should locate the motor within the skin tube of the airframe.
	- It should handle the forces due to the thrust produced by the motor.

The motor mount is located between the motor and the outer skin of the rocket tube. It's dimensions must,
therefore, be known early on in the design phase for better fitment. Since a solid rocket motor is being used for this
project, the proposed motor mount is to consist of a mounting tube and centering rings/bulkheads for ensuring
concentricity and locating the mounting tube in the airframe tube. 

The inner diameter of the mounting tube is dictated by the outer diameter of the rocket motor. The outer diameter of 
mounting tube determines the inner diameter of the bulkheads. The bulkheads are to be made of aluminum or polycarbonate.
Depending on the desired arrangement we can have two main configurations for the motor mount:

	1. Mounting tube integral with the retaining bulkhead.
		- THe mounting tube and retaining bulkhead are machined from one piece of metal. THe only additional 
		  component required is the locationg ring at the other end of the mounting tube. 
		- This enables for quick locating and assembly of the motor mount.
		- Reduces the number of bulkheads to be used.
		- Machining the mounting tube may be difficult.

	2. Mounting tube separate from bulkheads. 
		- This system used a mounting tube and several bulkheads arranged throughout the length of the motor bay
		  for locating and securign the tube in place.
		- Requires several bulkheads.
		- Longer assembly time.

The decision on the mounting configuration will depend on the size of motor selected i.e. thrust and weight since the
mount is supposed to hold the motor in place on application of full thrust.
